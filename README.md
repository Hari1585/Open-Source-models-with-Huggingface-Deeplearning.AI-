NLP Tasks 
1. Text Generation 
2. Sentenec Similarity
3. summarization
4. Machine Translation

need to have llm pre-requisites

Translation and Summarization
Translation: we use no longer Left Behind model 

 Sentecnce Embedding / Similarity
1. it says how close two pieces of text are 
2. The sentence similarity is perticulary usefull for "Information Retreval" and 'Clustering' or 'Grouping'
3. The Model converts the input text into vectors or embedding and these embedding captures the semantic information that encodes the followin information
4. We usae cosine similarity

#Zero-shot Audio Classification
1. The Transformers model Treat input as a sequence and rely on attension mechanism  to learn the audio representation 
2. The Always need  to check the sampling rate of the trained model of audio and Data set should be matched for higher accuracy
3. If the Text input that strongly co-relates with the audio input we get high similarity score
